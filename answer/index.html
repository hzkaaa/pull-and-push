                <a href="#" class="dead-link" >A3:</a> I think the way people socialise in London is different to our country,
                  it's more diverse and open.

                <a href="#" class="dead-link" >A4:</a> In my opinion, firstly I get to meet more people from different backgrounds and countries, 
                secondly there is a different cultural environment and finally there is a lot of good dating scene.
